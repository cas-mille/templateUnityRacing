# Template: Unity Racing

A basic template for **racing-like games** in **Unity (5.3.2.)**.

The template is made for an **introductury workshop / short game jam** about **game design and game development**, mainly to bring up (and answer some) questions around these topics.

But it can also be used for **whatever you like**!
